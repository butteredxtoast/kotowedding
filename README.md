Hey Bill,

my name is Ryan "rb" Blomberg CTO @ Sendlane

I asked my recruiter to try to start a conversation and she said you rejected her so I am trying another way that may catch you by suprise and get you to at least entertain a call with me.

Just super casual.  I have no idea if your skillset matches up with my team here but your LI profile looked compelling and it never hurts to just talk things over.  Worst case you get a CTO level contact out of it :)

Congrats on your engagment
